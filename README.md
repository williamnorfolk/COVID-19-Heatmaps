## Time Series COVID-19 Data Visualizations

This repository contains all of the raw data, code, and figure files used to create and analyze time series COVID-19 case data for dissemination. Raw data was sourced from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CCSE) data repository found at [this link](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). 

Data visualizations are **updated daily** following the release of new reports typically between 21:00 and 22:00 hours EST. All new raw data reports are added into the ```raw_data``` folder within the repositry and modified to a clean data object through a series of analysis scripts retained within the ```analysis_code``` folder.
